									<h2>Project Summary</h2>
									<p>Itâ€™s not just forests that matter: In Africa, trees on farms provide substantial benefits</p>

								<h3>The issue:</h3>
								<p>Trees on farms are often overlooked in research and policy on agriculture, forests, and rural livelihoods in Sub-Saharan Africa. Forestry as a field largely focuses on trees in forests rather than outside them. The focus in agriculture is usually on annual crops.  One consequence of this separation is limited empirical knowledge of the prevalence of trees on farms and their economic contribution across the continent.  Sub-national case studies suggest that on-farm trees can be important to household welfare, but there is little national-scale evidence. </p>

								<h3>The analysis:</h3>

								<p>This study uses nationally representative data from the Living Standards Measurement Study - Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) in five African countries: Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, Uganda and, Tanzania. Together, these countries represent 41% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa and cover a wide array of agro-ecological zones. The dataset includes information from more than geo-referenced 20,000 households surveyed during 2010-2012.  This also permits examining the effect of variables such as distance to forest, population, soil quality, and other relevant variables. This information is used to picture and explain the prevalence of trees on farms across the study countries.</p>
